# ML-Driven-User-Segmentation-for-Wolt-Market-Analysis

Following is a data-driven project that leverages ML techniques to perform user segmentation for Wolt Market, Finland. By utilizing the K-means clustering algorithm from sci-kit-learn, the project segments Wolt Market service users based on their ordering history and behavior.

The project starts with extensive exploratory data analysis (EDA) using Pandas, NumPy, and Matplotlib. This step identifies essential factors for user segmentation and evaluates the model's performance. The data is then cleaned and features are engineered to improve the accuracy of the segmentation model.

The results of the K-means clustering analysis provide valuable insights into distinct user segments, enabling targeted marketing and personalized services. The project concludes with actionable information and recommendations for the Wolt Market team, aiding them in optimizing their business strategies based on the identified user segments.

The findings and recommendations are effectively communicated through visualizations created with Matplotlib and Seaborn libraries. These visualizations provide a clear and intuitive representation of the user segments, making it easier for stakeholders to grasp the results and take data-driven actions.

The project aims to empowers Wolt Market with data-driven decision-making capabilities, enhancing customer satisfaction and overall market performance.
